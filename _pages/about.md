# About

I have always preferred a simple, fuss-free, minimalist approach on things and this is how I start my research to a place for my thoughts and hopefully pass on my learnings to you.

I decided to start my storytelling journey with [GitHub Pages][1]. First, I do not have to buy a domain and a server. Second, it supports [Markdown][2]. It is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on easy formatting conventions. Third, [GitHub Pages][1] supports a _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ called [Jekyll][3]. While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this Theme called [Tale][4] too - and voila I have all I need to begin.

It basically means I can write and share my writing to anyone with any tools without platform-dependency or vendor lock-in and whatsoever. With all my content published with a nice theme automatically every time I save my content.

Now, this is a place where my thoughts called home.

Perhaps you can have the same too!
