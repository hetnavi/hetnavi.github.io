## Cognitive Offloading

* write down all the thoughts
* to spend your brain capacity to process what to do
* not trying to remember what to do

## Paced-Spacing

* instead of study 2 hours before an exam
* read 1 hour daily and separated over a span of a few days
* to space some time for brain to absorb/digest the information
* e.g. exam on Friday, instead of study on Thu, should study on Mon and Wed

## The üçÖ Pomodoro Technique

### What

* a time management system
* that encourages people to work with the time they have‚Äîrather than against it
* Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by 5-minute breaks
    * Why 25min?
        * it's the perfect length of time to help you not procrastinate
        * be productive
        * create urgency
        * help you stay focused on any task you are tackling.
* After about 4 pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes

### How

* Pick a task
* Set a 25min timer
    * turn off everything (e.g. instant message, notification)
* work on the task until the timer rings
    * the idea is not to provide full solution in 25min
    * but to laser-focus and 100% attention to the task
* take a short 5min break/fun/relax
* every 4 pomodoros, take a longer 15-20min break/fun/relax
