## What makes a TED talk great?

* Use stories to create engaging and inspiring presentations
* Mesmerize your audience with just your spoken word
* Make your message memorable

## Storytelling

### Start with a story to captivate your audience

* with a powerful beginning that will incline to listen
    * the whole talk lasts only 18min
    * a person takes 30 seconds to get bored with a speech
* stories trigger the audience to search their memory banks for similar experiences
* keep them curious and entertained

### Add Conflict

* a fight between opposing forces
    * life and death
    * love and hate
    * freedom and oppression

### Visualize stories

* storytelling with image

### Engage all 5 senses

* VAKOG
    * Visual (sight)
    * Auditory (sound)
    * Kinesthetic (touch, emotion)
    * Olfactory (taste)
    * Gustatory (smell)
* storytelling from image to motion pictures

### Be generous with specific details

* _"a woman was tall"_ -> _"about 7 foot 6 inches"_
* _"after a while"_ or _"some time later"_ -> _"5 days later"_

### Lead your audience emotionally high/low

* Positive-message stories
    * "The pursuit of happyness" stories are inspiring
* Negative-message stories
    * depressing but has a didactic (intended to teach) point

### Lighten up your story with the spark, change, and takeaway

* Spark
    * a carefully articulated wisdom
    * or idea that brings the character to their victory of overcoming the conflict
* Change
    * the actual change (physical, emotional, and/or mental) that redirects the flow of the story
* Takeaway
    * the key message that explains how the change occurred and what you should when it did

## Story Structure

* Character
    * Sandy
* Conflict/Difficulty
    * suffering chronic depression, always eat more but more depressed
* Spark
    * after 10-hour long of spasm/cramp, finally decided to seek help from therapist
* Change
    * a year later, blooming young woman
* Takeaway
    * overcome weakness and don't try to cover up

## Tips

* watch videos of great speakers
* write down the full text of your story
* practice giving your presentation in front of a mirror
* choose different people to tell your story
